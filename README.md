# UoS³ Training Scheme

This repository contains the material used for the UoS³ Training Scheme, a
programme designed to give students the knowledge required to work on the UoS³
project.

The scheme is split into three parts: [**platform**](#platform),
[**software**](#software), and [**electronics**](#electronics):

## Platform

This part focusses on UoS³ specific content, such as the mission, subsystems,
and interfaces.

## Software

This part covers the software concepts required to develop the flight software
for UoS³ in a generic way, so that these skills could be transfered to other
platforms in the future.

## Electronics

Similarly to the software part this part covers electronics from a general
perspective so that it may be applicable to more than just UoS³.
